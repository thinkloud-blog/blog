Adds the latest Google Universal Analytics JavaScript tracking code to your WordPress website. Many options!

== Description ==

Adding Google Analytics code to your website has never been easier. Simply copy and paste your tracking code or property ID and that's it. 

Why Google Universal Analytics is better than the usual Google Analytics? 

* Event tracking (track downloads, mailto links, clicks on external URLs and Call tracking);
* Remarketing;
* Demographics and Interests reporting;
* IP Anonymization;
* Enhanced Link Attribution;
* Custom domain configuration;
* Disable Google Analytics tracking for specific WordPress users;
* Older Google Analytics tracking available;
* Tracking code customization;
* Simplified user interface;
* It is the new analytics standard set by Google;
* ...and more.
